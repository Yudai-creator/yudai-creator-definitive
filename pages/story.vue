        <h1>More about me</h1>
        <p>Hey there, if you are reading this, you already know my name and some information of my persona. My intention with this page is to short a little more about myself and my journey so far, something that I donâ€™t share that often in social media platforms. So without further discussion letâ€™s do this.</p>

        <h2>How I got started</h2>
        <p>
            This goes back to year 2011, exactly December 21st , that I received a gift from my father, my first computer, a desktop PC, Windows 7, 2GB of RAM, Intel Dual Core and NVIDIA G-Force 502. That event I feel changed my life forever, I will remember that day â€˜till the end of times. I was 13 years old and I was getting into tech without noticing it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Way before that date, I desired for computer since I was like 6 years old, that I spend all my afternoons in the computer lab in elementary school, it was the only place I had to go and do stuff with a computer. They worked with Windows XP those days.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was so amazed with everything I could do with that piece of equipment, just sitting in front of a screen. Drawing crazy stuff in Paint, create funny designs with Power Point, edit videos, play games, learn math with educational software. It never seems to end, all the possibilities that I had.
            <br>
            <br>
            For that I fell in love very early with technology and computers, and from a very young age I was already decided to work with computers one day.
        </p>

        <h2>The foundation</h2>
        <p>
            After getting my first computer, a dream come true, I started to explore more and more the possibilities I had, not gonna lie, most time all I did was playing games jjj, but I discovered that I could do so many things that many people struggled around me, like editing videos, people used to pay some other person to do that, editing photos, the same as before. Until I get to the point of asking myself how software is created, how does that work? 
            <br>
            <br>
            With that question in mind, year 2016 I elected to enter what you may call Engineering School to study Computer Science, we call it differently in my home country. From that decision the real journey to where I am today started.
        </p>

        <h2>The journey</h2>
        <p>
            So I got into college, at that time before getting there, I have never had access to internet, it was that year, 2016, that I first experienced what using internet was. Also I did knew what the heck programming and software development actually was. Starting my first year in college these to facts that I just explained, after actually experience them, it blew my mind off, just like this meme jjj
            <br>
            <br>
            It was the first time in my life that I was scary because I did not knew about something, and most of all I did not knew how to actually learn it. First challenge appeared.
            <br>
            <br>
            To make long story short, I failed a lot, I was told that I was not good for it a lot, but all that crap did not stop me from learning and advancing towards my goal, that was getting to work with computers.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started learning programming with Java, programming language that some of you may know and hate, or not jjjjj. I learned about the fundamentals of programming and computer science, software engineering, how actually software is developed, all the process behind it. A whole new world of opportunities in front of me, amazing knowledge that I would apply later in the future.
            <br>
            <br>
            At that I time everything that I was learning was only with the resources teachers and academics gave me, it did not exist the habit of learning the self-taught way. That was something that damage me for some time, because I was walking a path that other people made for the students to follow, and no other path was correct. This was something that shocked me, I felt that I was loosing my freedom to learn.
            <br>
            <br>
            With that in mind, we arrived to 2019, my third year of college, where I found myself at the bottom of my career, I failed a lot of exams that got me to the point that I had to re-do the semester. It was the worst that could ever happened to me, or so I thought. I took that fail as an opportunity to have free time, time to think about and explore outside the box of college, if the path I was walking was the one I wanted it to follow.
            <br>
            <br>
            By that time, internet access was open to the public, it was not required anymore to be in college to get internet access, and something I did not mention, internet in this institutions was limited and restricted for students to explore everything they want, by school policies.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thanks to that opening of the internet I was able to get what I want, freedom to explore the real tech world, explore how to learn for real, how you get jobs, how many technologies are there. It was a game changer for me.
        </p>

        <h2>The real journey</h2>
        <p>
            By the end of 2019, something terrible happened to our world, Covid-19 happened, thank god my family and loved ones never suffered any loss. For everyone those days where kind of dark and despering, locked in our houses expecting for the world to heal.
            <br>
            <br>
            With the lockdown, no more college for a long time, I was on my own, at home with nothing to do, except the fact that I had internet connection to keep exploring my stuff. It was the perfect time for me to explore everything.
            <br>
            <br>
            I discovered a new way to learn thanks to open internet, I had so many resources to learn, for free. I started getting into web development, learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, and I was enjoying a lot learning those. So I decided to follow that lead, web development, one of the best decisions I ever made because it made discover everything that I know today.
            <br>
            <br>
            During those days of exploration I realize that I needed to meet people with my same interests, I wanted to learn more and more, I cannot do it solo. I started looking on social media, until I discovered what I call today the best community of people in the tech field, TECH TWITTER. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This discovery was another game changer for me, I started to connect with people with my same interests, same goals, same ways to learn, it was an amazing feeling. I started to learn a lot from their experiences.
            <br>
            <br>
            They taught me how to improve my skills as developer, found jobs, contribute to open-source, how to learn new skills, how to connect with people and be helpful and above all, how to make honest relationships between people from around the world. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I was all set, this is the path I wanted to follow, a path of freedom, where I could learn at my own pase, and share my work with the world.
        </p>

        <h2>To infinity and beyond ðŸš€</h2>
        <p>
            After one year of working hard, improve my skills as developer and designer, and increase my network, I finally got a full-time job opportunity as Web Interface Developer, one of the best days of my life, because I was witness that my own hard work and sacrifice did paid off.
            <br>
            <br>
            That take us to where I am today, where Iâ€™m really happy with every decision I made, and every fail I had because it took me to this point, and I have no regrets.
            <br>
            <br>
            My only wish from now on is to donâ€™t stop learning new stuff, keep improving my skills as a professional, and keep adding value to the world with my craft.
            <br>
            <br>
